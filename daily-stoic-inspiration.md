    Why stoic inspiration?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The Stoic philosophy is an ancient practice that accepts that the world is not perfect, but recognizes that how we react to that is entirely within our control.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The life and times of the ancient Stoics were hard, yet some of civilization&#8217;s greatest accomplishments were achieved then. Think about your modern life. Things might be hard, but are they life-and-death hard?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Use the wisdom of the Stoics to help ground yourself in your day to day life.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
