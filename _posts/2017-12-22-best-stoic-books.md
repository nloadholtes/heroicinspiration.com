Stoicism is a timeless philosophy that is finding lots of renewed interest thanks to people like Tim Ferris and Ryan Holiday. 

These are the books that best represent the way of the Stoics for our modern times.

## The Obstacle Is The Way 

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1513976764&sr=8-1&keywords=the+obstacle+is+the+way+by+ryan+holiday&linkCode=li3&tag=nloadholtes0a-20&linkId=fd267dcd7045085dd81dd25130c5dedd" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1591846358&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=nloadholtes0a-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nloadholtes0a-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1591846358" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

 This book is a best seller for a very good reason. The author, Ryan Holiday, take Stoicism and breaks it down into small chunks that are very relate-able to our modern day. 

This is the book I recommend for someone just getting into Stoicism. It takes the ancient yet timeless wisdom and presents it in a very accessible way.

Ryan is a big advocate of Stoicism and has written several more books on the subject. 
 
## Meditations

Marcus Aurelius was the 16th Emperor of Rome. He wrote down his thoughts in a journal as a way to empty his mind. Many of his journals were combined into this book which is considered one of the cornerstones of Stoic philosophy.

It is worth noting that because these were in his journals many believe they were never meant for publication. As a result these are snapshots into the daily life one of the most power men in the world at that time. While reading the book it occurred to me that even though he lived thousands of years ago and was way more powerful, he too had to deal with the same crap that I do.

This book is not as easy to read as The Obstacle Is The Way. The translation by Gregory Hays does a great job of putting the words of Marcus Aurelius into "modern" English. But the text can read like a like college text book at times. There are plenty of quotable passages in the book, but occasionally there will be a wall of text that requires a more than a quick scan to comprehend.
