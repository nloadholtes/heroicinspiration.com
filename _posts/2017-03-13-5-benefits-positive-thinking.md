Feeling down in the dumps? Positive thinking can turn that around and make all the difference in the world. Here&#8217;s some great reasons to stay positive!

## If you believe it, you can achieve it

The mind is a funny thing: it becomes what you tell it to. So, if you sit around telling yourself Â how bad things are&#8230; guess what? Things will seem bad. It&#8217;s true! Think about all the times you&#8217;ve been down and how everything around you seemed terrible.

The great news is that if you tell yourself things are not that bad&#8230; you will start to think things are not that bad! Positive thinking leads one to see the possibilities of life, not just the negative things.

If nothing else, consider this: it costs you nothing to try and think positive so why not try it? If it is bullshit, then you&#8217;ve lost nothing. However if it is true&#8230; then you&#8217;ve hit the jack pot!

## A rising tide lifts all boats

Much like negative thinking leads to negative&#8230; well everything, positive thinking leads to positive people. Just like negativity, positiveness is contagious! One positive person in a group can spread positive thoughts like wildfire.

Just imagine the possibilities of a group that is positive and on the same page! That&#8217;s how championships get won, how people get put on the moon, and how an awesome concert happens!

## A ray of sunshine

Overly positive people have a reputation of being a little bit annoying. But that doesn&#8217;t have to be you! Just being generally positive is enough to help boost those around you without being super annoying.

A result of that positivity is that most people are going to like having you around. An overly negative person quickly wears people. Who wants to be around someone who saps your energy and spirit? A positive person has the opposite effect, their presence encourages people around them to be better.

## Get lucky!

Does positive thinking lead to better luck? Maybe not, but people who are positive tend to be more open to new things. And if positive people are surrounded by other people who are being influenced to be more positive (see the &#8220;ray of sunshine&#8221; section above) then more than likely they are going to find that more people are willing to include them on opportunities.

As an example: If you won 2 tickets to an exciting concert who would you rather go with? Your friend who always finds a way to complain about everything? Or your friend who is always in a pretty good mood and makes everyone laugh?

I know who I&#8217;d rather spend time with&#8230; and I&#8217;d be willing to bet that if you asked both those friends to rate &#8220;how lucky they are&#8221; you would find the happier friend feels more lucky than the negative friend.

Coincidence? Maybe not&#8230;

## Live Longer

If nothing else in this article convinces you of the benefits of positive thinking it should be this. Positive people live longer.

Ok, its a powerful statement, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-r-hamilton-phd/positive-people-live-long_b_774648.html" target="_blank">the research around this seems to support this line of thinking</a>. Just combining the observations above it is pretty clear that there&#8217;s something to being positive and thinking positive thoughts.

If nothing else it looks like people who think positive have a better life!
