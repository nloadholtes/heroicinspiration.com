Recently on Facebook, I asked &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nloadholtes/posts/282546895493231" target="_blank">What&#8217;s your favorite quote?</a>&#8221; I got some really great responses that I thought I would share here!

###### **Many hands make light work!**

My aunt contributed this one, and it is so true. The next time you&#8217;ve got a big task to do, try and get some friends to help out. You will be surprised how quickly it gets done!

###### **If you don&#8217;t stand for something, you will fall for anything.**

This is a powerful truth. Standing up for something can be really scary, but it is so worth it in the end. The most inspiring people are the ones that have stood up for something they believed in.

The flip side of that is seen everywhere these days. People who don&#8217;t have a core belief in something wind up being pulled along. Don&#8217;t be that person, instead find something you believe in and stand up for it!

Here are some more classic inspiring quotes:

###### **Treat others the way you want to be treated**

This quote is so famous it has its own name, &#8220;The golden rule&#8221;. Variations of this areÂ found in cultures all over the world since the beginning of time. It is a solid nugget of wisdom that more people should follow on a daily basis.

###### What we think, we become

This quote has a lot of variations attributed to a lot of people. When Buddha said it so long ago it was a deep truth that many people today still struggle to learn. If you think positive, you will become positive. Think negative thoughts&#8230; well, it isn&#8217;t pretty.

###### If opportunity doesn&#8217;t knock, build a door

Milton Berle gets credit for this gem that could be the rallying cry for generations of entrepreneurs. We live in a time where it has never been easier to start something and have millions of people see it instantly. What could you be doing right now that would build a door that opportunity could start knocking on?
